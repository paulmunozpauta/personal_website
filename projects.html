                <strong>ERASMUS+: Cooperation partnerships in higher education: Nature-Based Solutions for Water Innovation, Sustainability,
                    and Ecosystems</strong><br>
                <em>Belgium, Germany, Slovenia. 2025-2028</em><br>
                NBsWISE enhances Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) for hydroclimatic risk management through education, research, digital
tools, and stakeholder engagement. It integrates IoT sensors, AI models, and GIS tools to improve NbS monitoring. The
project trains students, researchers, and policymakers, engages citizens in NbS monitoring, and fosters policy integration.
Expected outcomes include digital learning resources, real-world case studies, and high-level stakeholder events.

                <strong>Global Minds: Building Resilient Water Futures in the Global South through Digital Tools and Citizen Engagement (DIGIWATER) </strong><br>
                <em>Cuba — 2025</em><br>
                DIGIWATER is a strategic initiative led by VUB to catalyse long-term academic and institutional change in the Global South by strengthening collaboration with partners at UCLV, UWC, UCUENCA, UCB, USP, PUCP, and UNIANDES in the field of water resilience. The long-term vision is to create an open, inclusive, and well-coordinated ecosystem where universities across Latin America, Africa, and Europe co-develop knowledge, apply digital tools, and engage in sustained collaboration on research and training for sustainable water governance. .
